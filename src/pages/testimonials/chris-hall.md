I had the pleasure of working with Joshua Pendragon, who served as a Support Engineer and later transitioned seamlessly into the role of a Quality Assurance professional, encompassing both manual and automation testing. 

During his tenure, Joshua consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic and dedication to his responsibilities. He exhibited a remarkable ability to navigate through the challenges of both support and quality assurance roles, showcasing versatility and adaptability.

One of Joshua's standout qualities was his unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction. He interacted with customers in a highly professional and friendly manner, always striving to address their concerns with diligence and courtesy. Joshua was not just a skilled technical professional, but also a great communicator who could deliver even difficult news with honesty and tact.

His contributions to our team were valuable, and his positive attitude in the face of challenges left a lasting impression. I am confident that Joshua will bring the same level of commitment and expertise to any future endeavors.

Wishing Joshua all the best in his future career pursuits.
