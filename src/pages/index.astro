                My name is Joshua Pendragon. I’m a Software Development Engineer in Test / QA Engineer with a track
                record of leading cross‑product automation and performance testing, mentoring teams, and driving
                continuous improvement across engineering organizations. I began my career in the US Navy as a
                Cryptologic Technician, where I developed the attention to detail and analytical skills that still
                guide my work today.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a QA Engineer at SecurityScorecard, I lead talks and
                presentations as Head of the QA guild and on the AI adoption culture committee. I build and
                configure LLM tools to augment velocity for engineers, managers, and other stakeholders, and mentor a
                team of QA engineers to modernize Quality processes, tooling, and pipelines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Previously, I was a Staff QA Engineer at Sorenson Communications. I
                standardized multiple disparate test projects, designed and implemented new systems, and acted as a
                QA Mentor/SME. I created and shipped org‑internal report processing and setup/teardown libraries,
                drafted ADRs and other supporting documentation, and refactored projects to unlock parallelization
                and multi‑environment A/B testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earlier at OvationCXM, I led a Playwright project covering front‑end E2E,
                API integration, and performance testing, graduating from contributor to owning cross‑product test
                development. I shipped resilient automated smoke coverage in CI/CD (~80 test cases in ~17 minutes at
                4 worker threads), mentored teammates, contributed unit tests and product code reviews, and ran
                workshops. I also handled daily triage of Datadog alerts, pipeline failures, and user‑reported
                issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                I care deeply about alignment and clarity. I look for the smallest change with the biggest impact—
                whether that’s writing new test coverage, drafting documentation to de‑silo knowledge, or bringing
                the right data and perspective to decision‑makers.
            </p>
            <p>
                For professional growth, I’m currently exploring Rust and Go, along with data tools like SurrealDb.
                When I’m not coding, I’m usually chatting with friends on Discord while running content in WoW or
                FFXIV, working through my Steam backlog, or practicing a tune from Stronghold on the mandolin.
            </p>
