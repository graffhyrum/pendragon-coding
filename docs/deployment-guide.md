# Deployment Guide

How pendragon-coding gets from source to production on Netlify.

## Deployment Model

**Production** updates only when a **git tag** `v*` is pushed and `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs: it builds with Bun and uploads `dist/` to Netlify via the Netlify API (`nwtgck/actions-netlify`). That tag is created by `release.yml` after Changesets **publishes** when you merge the “Version packages” PR — not on every routine merge to `main`.

**Netlify’s Git-connected builder** is intentionally disabled for all contexts: `netlify.toml` sets `ignore = "exit 0"`, so Netlify **skips** every build triggered by pushes to `main` (or branches). You avoid a redundant Netlify build and deploy on every commit; the live site still updates when the tag pipeline finishes.

### Verifying a release

1. Merge the Version PR → watch **GitHub Actions** → `Release` completes with publish and **Create Git Tag** pushing `v{version}`.
2. **Deploy to Production** (`deploy.yml`) runs on that tag push — this is the deploy that matters.
3. In the Netlify UI, a **skipped/canceled** Git build for `main` is **expected**; look for a **successful** deploy produced by the API / Actions (deploy message like `Deploy from tag v…`), not a completed Netlify “build from Git” for every `main` commit.

```

### Step-by-step

1. **Create a changeset** -- run `bunx changeset` and describe the change. This creates a markdown file in `.changeset/`.
2. **Merge PR to main** -- the `release.yml` workflow fires on every push to `main`.
3. **Changesets action** -- if unreleased changesets exist, the action opens a "Version Packages" PR that bumps `package.json` and updates `CHANGELOG.md`. If that PR is already open, it updates it.
4. **Merge the Version PR** -- Changesets publishes: it consumes the changeset files, finalizes the changelog, and commits the version bump.
5. **Tag creation** -- the release workflow creates a git tag `v{version}` and pushes it.
6. **Deploy** -- the tag push triggers `deploy.yml`, which checks out the code, installs dependencies with Bun, runs `bun run build`, and deploys the `dist/` directory to Netlify using `nwtgck/actions-netlify@v3.0`.

## Pre-build Checks

The `prebuild` script runs automatically before `bun run build`:

```
tsgo --noEmit && bunx astro check
```

- `tsgo --noEmit` -- TypeScript type checking without emitting files
- `bunx astro check` -- Astro-specific template and configuration validation

If either check fails, the build aborts and the deploy does not proceed.

### RCA: “Node.js v20.20.2 is not supported by Astro” in GitHub Actions

| What the log implies         | What actually failed                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tsgo --noEmit` printed last | `prebuild` runs `bun typecheck && bunx astro check`. `tsgo` finished; the next step is **`bunx astro check`**. |

**Proof (local tree):**

1. `package.json` `prebuild` is `bun typecheck && bunx astro check` — Astro runs in the second clause after typecheck.
2. `node_modules/astro/package.json` declares `"engines": { "node": ">=22.12.0" }`.
3. `node_modules/astro/bin/astro.mjs` starts with `#!/usr/bin/env node` and hardcodes `const engines = '>=22.12.0';` — the CLI is executed by **Node from `PATH`**, not the Bun runtime, so the runner’s default Node (historically **20.x** on `ubuntu-latest` when `setup-node` is missing) produces exactly: `Node.js v20.20.2 is not supported by Astro!`.

**Netlify logs** for this repo: Git builds are skipped by `ignore = "exit 0"`, so you will see “Canceled build due to no content change” / ignore exit 0 — that is **not** the same failure as the Actions log above. Production depends on `deploy.yml` succeeding after the tag push.

**Fix:** `deploy.yml` runs `actions/setup-node` with Node **≥22.12** before `bun install` / `bun run build` so `node` on `PATH` satisfies Astro’s CLI. Bun remains the package manager and script runner.

## Manual Deployment

To deploy a specific commit manually:

```bash
# Create and push a tag
git tag v2.6.2
git push origin v2.6.2
```

This triggers `deploy.yml` directly, bypassing the Changesets flow. Use this only for hotfixes or when the automated pipeline is not suitable.

## Rollback

Two approaches:

1. **Re-tag a previous commit** -- check out the known-good commit, tag it with a new version, and push the tag. The deploy workflow builds and deploys that commit.

   ```bash
   git checkout v2.6.0
   git tag v2.6.1-hotfix
   git push origin v2.6.1-hotfix
   ```

2. **Revert and re-release** -- revert the problematic commit on `main`, let Changesets create a new version, and deploy through the normal pipeline.

## Netlify Configuration

From `netlify.toml`:

- **Build command**: `bun run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist/`
- **Ignore builds**: `ignore = "exit 0"` on `[build]`, `[context.production]`, and `[context.branch-deploy]` — Netlify **never** runs its own build for Git events; see [Netlify ignore builds](https://docs.netlify.com/build/configure-builds/ignore-builds/) (exit 0 skips the build). Production traffic is updated by **Actions** on tag deploys only.
